List of computational science fields, and learning materials.

## Computational Science 101: 

Computational science is an interdisciplinary field that uses advances computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. It integrates principles from computer science, applied mathematics, and domain specific science to create simulations, models, and analyses of natural and  engineered systems.

### Foundations of Computational Science.

**Computer science ->** Algorithms and Data strucutres, Programming languages & High-performance computing.

**Applied Mathematics ->** Numerical Analysis, Statistics and probability, & Optimization.

**Domain-specific Science ->** Fields like Physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and social sciences provide the specific problems and context for computational models.

### Components of Computational science

#### Modeling and simulation:

##### Modeling:

Creating mathematical representation of real-world systems. Models can be deterministic or stochastic, static or dynamic.

##### Simulation:

Using computational methods to solve models, to study system's behavior under various conditions. 

#### Data Analysis and Visualization

##### Data analysis: 

Techniques to process and interpret large datasets, often using machine learning and statistical methods.

##### Visualization:

Graphical representation of data and simulation results to help understand complex patterns and trends.
